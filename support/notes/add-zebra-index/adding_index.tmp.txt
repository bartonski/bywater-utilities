 ~ashimema@cpc1-stev6-2-0-cust281.9-2.cable.virginm.net (OFTC)                                                                                                
15:27 -!- Irssi: Starting query in OFTC with ashimema
15:27 <ashimema> The zebra configuration is made up of a series of interconnected files serving different purposes:
15:27 <ashimema> ~/kohaclone/etc/zebradb/biblios/etc/bib1.att
15:27 <ashimema> Links Z39.50 attribute to zebra index name (Documentation for bib1 is available at LOC)
15:27 <ashimema> ~/kohaclone/etc/zebradb/marc_defs/marc21/biblios/record.abs
15:27 <ashimema> Links marc field to zebra index name
15:27 <ashimema> ~/kohaclone/etc/zebradb/ccl.properties
15:27 <ashimema> Koha searchable indexes (to be searchable by Koha, the zebra index must appear in here)
15:27 <ashimema> ~/kohaclone/etc/zebradb/pqf.properties
15:27 <ashimema> SRU searchable indexes (to be searchable by SRU, the zebra index must appear in here)
15:28 <ashimema> that's obviosely in a dev setup.. but the files are the same even if the locations are different
15:29 <barton> sorry -- SRU?
15:30 <ashimema> SRU is z39.50 (but newer ;) )
15:30 <ashimema> one tic, i'm just dumping my braindump for the ptfs-europe private wiki into a sub-page on my username on the community wiki.. it'll make 
                 more sense that way.
15:31 <ashimema> sru is the publically accessable search api.. you have to enable it in koha-conf.xml if you want to use it.. most libraries don't turn it on 
                 it seems

Field to index: 907$a

Preparation
1) In the steps below, replace '596$a' with '907$a' and '596a' with '907a' (g/596/907/g ought to do the trick)
2) Make sure that we're suing dom indexing.
3) Change all the paths below to match aarome.
4) Find out what to put in place of the arabic text.
5) Are we *really* edting C4/koha.pm???

Step 1 Set up DOM indexing
    You probably want to use Zebra with dom indexing. 
    Package sites are usually GRS-1. If koha-conf.xml contains the two lines

     <zebra_bib_index_mode>dom</zebra_bib_index_mode>
     <zebra_auth_index_mode>dom</zebra_auth_index_mode>

    In the same section as the <database>, <user> and <pass> tags MySQL, the site uses DOM. Otherwise, you will have to ask larryb to convert it and re-index.

Step 2 Edit the index definitions.

    Edit /etc/koha/zebradb/marc_defs/marc21/biblios/record.abs 

        This file contains GRS1 configuraiton; the file won't be used by DOM, but it's a good idea to keep these in sync.

        add this line
         melm 596$a      Note596a:w

    Edit /etc/koha/zebradb/marc_defs/marc21/biblios/biblio-koha-indexdefs.xml

       Add the following lines:
         <index_data_field xmlns="http://www.koha-community.org/schemas/index-defs" tag="596" subfields="a">
           <target_index>Note596a:w</target_index>
         </index_data_field>

    Note 
        596$a is the tag and subfield you want to make index for
        Note596a is the index name
        w the type of index (unless you know what you are doing, leave it as ':w')

Step 3 Set up bib-1 (aka Z39.50) attributes.

edit /etc/koha/zebradb/biblios/etc/bib1.att

    Add this line
        att 65 Note596a

    Note 
        The attribute number (65 in this example) can be selected from the Bib-1 attribute set (see http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/defns/bib1.html#use ) or a new attribute number can be made up.
        Note596a is the index name

Step 4

In this path /etc/koha/zebradb/ccl.properties

    Add this line 

        Note596a 1=65

    Note that
        In '1=65', the character befrore the '=' is the numeral 1. 
        Note596a is the index name
        1=65 is the number of new indexes you add

Step 5
    Run the following command
         xsltproc /etc/koha/zebradb/xsl/koha-indexdefs-to-zebra.xsl /etc/koha/zebradb/marc_defs/marc21/biblios/biblio-zebra-indexdefs.xml >/etc/koha/zebradb/marc_defs/marc21/biblios/biblio-zebra-indexdefs.xsl

Step 6 Rebuild zebra index
    Run the following command
         /usr/share/koha/bin/migration_tools/rebuild_zebra.pl -b -r -v

Step 7 Add new index to staff client

    edit /usr/share/koha/intranet/htdocs/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/includes/search_indexes.inc
      add the line
        <option value="Note596a"> </option>
      after all of the other <option value> tags.

Step 8 Add new index to OPAC
    edit /usr/share/koha/opac/htdocs/opac-tmpl/prog/en/modules/opac-advsearch.tt
      add the line
        <option value="Note596a"> </option>
      after all of the other <option value> tags.
