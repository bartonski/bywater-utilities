# Know Your Support Guy

Bywater solutions, at its heart, is a company built around technical
support. Because open source software costs no money, and the source code
is available to anyone, it would be possible, in principle, for a library
to download it, load it on to a computer and run it themselves. However,
if your reason for life is running a library, You don't want to have
to worry about the day to day support of Koha -- monitoring servers,
writing patches for bugs, keeping up to date on which of the latest
and greatest features are stable, writing bug reports, migrating data,
knowing the Linux command line and the Koha SQL schema like the back of
your hand. Bywater does all that, and much much more.

As such, everyone in Bywater from the CEO down, answers
support questions. Most of the staff has a dual role of some
sort - migration/support, development/support, sales/support,
training/support, system administration/support. There are
three of us who are dedicated *entirely* to support: [Jesse
Maseto](http://bywatersolutions.com/author/jesse/) (Head of
Support) , [Amy Kearns](http://bywatersolutions.com/author/amy/)
(Customer service, support ticket triage) , and
[me](http://bywatersolutions.com/author/barton/). Jesse and Amy are
deditated to making sure that the support _process_ working correctly,
but I'm the only person in the company whose job is _entirely_ deditated
to working support tickets. In short, I'm the support guy.

## Why is it important to know your support guy?

There are some challanges to supporting Koha. First and foremost, Koha is
[phenominally complex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl1a2VN_pec). Also,
Koha has developed internationally, which means that keeping consistent
terminology has been a challenge. This puts a premium on communication.
Good communication requires shared context. It's important for you to
know that there's a living breathing person listening to your questions,
and it's also important for me to know who you are and what you need --
not just on a single support ticket, but in the broader context. I'm
looking to share a few important bits of who I am, in order to plant
the seeds of a relationship with you, so that we can communiate more
effectively.
