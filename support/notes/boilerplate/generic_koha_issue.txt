I think that I'm going to need more information to be able to trouble shoot this issue:

1) How often does this problem occur? Are there issues every time you try to ... ? Does it average once per hour? Once per day?

2) Can you replicate the problem by ... ?

3) What web browser are you using? What browser version?

4) Is the issue browser specific (i.e. will it happen when ... in Chrome but not Firefox, or vise versa)?

5) Have you cleared the browser cache?
  -- firefox => https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache#w_clear-the-cache
  -- chrome => https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95582?hl=en

6) Can you capture the problem in a screencast? See http://bywatersolutions.com/2011/12/14/screencasts-for-koha-bugticket-reporting/
