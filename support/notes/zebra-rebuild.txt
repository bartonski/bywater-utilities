echo $HOME/run_rebuild.sh | at midnight

package sites:

1) check for ./run_rebuild.sh:
* sudo koha-shell <instance>
* cd $HOME
* ls ./run_rebuild.sh
* run using 'at', as above
2) If ./run_rebuils.sh isn't available
* exit koha-hsell
* test permissions by running the following at command:
* echo 'sudo koha-list > ./koha-list.out' at NOW
* Check the contents of ./koha-list.out
* In the following command, <instance> will be one of the lines from ./koha-list.out
* echo 'sudo koha-rebuild-zebra -f <instance>' | at midnight
* Probably best to test 'sudo' with 'at' before a live test, just to make sure permissions are set, and the process won't hang waiting for a sudo password.
