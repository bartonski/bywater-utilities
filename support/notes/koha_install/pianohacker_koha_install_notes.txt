14:56 -!- Irssi: Starting query in OFTC with pianohacker
14:56 <barton> What I've got set up so far is a git based install on a debian squeeze VM ... there are about half a dozen perl modules missing.
14:58 <pianohacker> The ones that aren't in the repositories?
14:59 <barton> Yeah ... they're available via CPAN, but I'm having problems getting them installed.
15:00 <pianohacker> Errors? Feel free to paste them in here
15:00 <barton> Graphics::Magick (optional), PDF::API2::Simple (required), Readonly::XS (optional), Text::Unaccent (required), XML::LibXSLT (required)
15:00 <barton> yeah, gimme a sec.
15:02 <barton> for PDF-API2-Simple : Can't locate inc/Module/Install.pm in @INC
15:03 <barton> ... seems like a problem with the tarball, but ???
15:03 <pianohacker> That is really bizarre. Let me try that on my VPS
15:03 <barton> The installer should be setting up its own include path, right?
15:04 <pianohacker> yeah, normally that isn't a problem... Do you have Module::Install installed?
15:05 <barton> hm. good question..
15:06 <barton> no, I didn't.
15:07 <barton> Installing now. That might fix it.
15:08 <barton> ok, that took care of PDF::API2::Simple.
15:08 <pianohacker> sweet.
15:08 <pianohacker> Do you have the development headers installed for GD?
15:09 <pianohacker> no, that's not what graphics::magick needs, nvm...
15:09 <barton> Text::Unaccent is failing its unit test.
15:10 <pianohacker> graphics magick is in the repos: libgraphics-magick-perl
15:10 <pianohacker> what error is unaccent giving?
15:10 <barton> I'm going to try to pastebin it ...
15:16 <barton> http://pastebin.com/ZtE5m0i8
15:17 <pianohacker> okay, this one is a lot weirder
15:18 <barton> It looked like there were some compiler warnings above ...
15:19 <pianohacker> yeah, looks like it's not just you: https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=29390
15:19 <pianohacker> install the version in the repos: libtext-unaccent-perl
15:20 <barton> where is that?
15:22 <pianohacker> that should be in the squeeze repositories: http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/libtext-unaccent-perl
15:22 <barton> right.
15:23 <barton> Just didn't know if you meant CPAN repositories, Koha repositories ... 
15:23 <pianohacker> Ah kk :)
15:23 <barton> lemmy tryit.
15:24  * barton hopes that mixing cpan and debian doesn't cause headaches.
15:25 <barton> satisfied the koha dependency. :-)
15:25 <barton> XML::LibXSLT is a tough nut:
15:26 <pianohacker> Just install as much as you can from the debian repos
15:26 <pianohacker> That way they get updated/patched
15:47 <barton> ok ... I got it built -- make && make test && make install worked just fine.
15:47 <barton> how do I turn it on?
15:58 <barton> nevermind ... looks like there are decent instructions in the INSTALL page.
16:16 <pianohacker> anything else I can help with?
16:21 <barton> no, I don't think so... I think that I'm going to chalk up what I learned on this VM to experience, then start again from scratch, following the INSTALL and INSTALL.DEBIAN notes as carefully as possible. I have a feeling that I took a few important steps out of order.
16:40 <pianohacker> Koha installs are always tricky :) Only advice I can offer is to install as much as you can from the Debian repos
16:41 <barton> hmm. the installation notes say exactly the opposite ;-)
16:42 <pianohacker> wat
16:42 <pianohacker> one sec
16:43 <pianohacker> did you use the set-selections piece?
16:43 <barton> the part where you select 'dev' vs ... whatever?
16:44 <pianohacker> 1.4 of install.debian
16:45 <barton> lemme check...
16:46 <barton> ah. I read that backwards. :-)
16:47 <pianohacker> haha, okay. I was about to be, "My whole life in #koha is a lie!"
16:48 <barton> HAHAHAHAHA
16:49 <barton> sorry. didn't mean to cause you to doubt your worldview. 
16:51 <pianohacker> eh, we work in libraries, shit like this happens
